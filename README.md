## What Is Wacky Flip?
**[Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.org)** is a skill-based, physics-driven stunt game where timing, coordination, and a sense of humor are your greatest allies. You control a floppy ragdoll athlete as they leap from dizzying heights, execute aerial tricks, and attempt to stick the landing with gymnastic precisionâ€”or fail hilariously trying.

### Key Features:
* 70 Unique Jumps across 7 action-packed levels
* 4 Distinct Environments: Baseball court, front yard, construction site, and playground
* Unlockable Arcade Mode for endless flipping and combo-chaining
* Trick Progression: Pike, Scissor, Knee Tuck, Layout, and more
* Ragdoll Physics: Every flip is unpredictable, funny, and thrilling

## Why Youâ€™ll Love It
Unlike traditional sports games, Wacky Flip thrives on unpredictability. Whether you're nailing a triple backflip or flailing through midair, every attempt feels fun and fresh. With a growing set of moves to unlock and a variety of settings to conquer, the game keeps you on your toesâ€”and laughingâ€”every step of the way.

## Skill Meets Mayhem
The controls are deceptively simple, but mastering them takes practice. Youâ€™ll need to:

* Crouch (hold tap/click)
* Jump (release)
* Flip (tap/click in-air)
* Land (release at the right moment)

Each phase is crucial, and perfecting the timing transforms Wacky Flip from goofy fun into a legit challenge.
